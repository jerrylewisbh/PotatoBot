TODO:
* Throttling?
* Exchange
    * Re-Check registration
    * Re-Test request of additional API permissions
    * Rewamp Settings so that instead of "Register" there is just an information about requesting additional access...
    * TESTING
* Check for concurrency/threading issues since "Session()!" was removed...
