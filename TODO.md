TODO:
* Throttling?
* Exchange
    * Rewamp Settings so that instead of "Register" there is just an information about requesting additional access...
    * Additional TESTING
    * Check suspension of sniping if funds are low
* Check for concurrency/threading issues since "Session()!" was removed...
* Discuss: 
    * Use consistent /s and /ah format or switch /s to CW Bot Format?
